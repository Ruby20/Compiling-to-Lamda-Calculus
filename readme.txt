Project 0: A compiler from Scheme to lambda CS 6475 Fall 2013


 In this project, we wrote a compiler from a rich subset of Scheme into the pure lambda calculus using Scala.

In the process, reviewed many core techniques in compilation: lexing, parsing, abstract syntax trees and tree transformation.
I took the parser for this project from Prof.Matt Might's blog post.
